msgid "You can just use your document with ``langchain`` to build a question-answering application. The implementation process of this project includes loading files -> reading text -> segmenting text -> vectorizing text -> vectorizing questions -> matching the top k most similar text vectors with the question vectors -> incorporating the matched text as context along with the question into the prompt -> submitting to the Qwen1.5-7B-Chat to generate an answer. Below is an example:"
